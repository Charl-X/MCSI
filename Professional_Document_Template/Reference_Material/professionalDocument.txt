When you are writing a professional document, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, be clear and concise. Use language that is easy to understand, and avoid complex jargon. Second, be organized. Make sure your ideas are presented in a logical manner, and use headings and subheadings to help your reader follow along. Finally, be professional. Use proper grammar and punctuation, and avoid slang and informal language.

	Use an easy-to-read font, such as Times New Roman or Arial.
	Use standard margins.

	Use paragraph spacing (1.5 lines) and line spacing (1.0 line) to create a visually appealing document.

	Use headings and subheadings to help organize your thoughts and make the document easier to read.

	Use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.

	Make sure your document is proofread and edited for mistakes.
	Perform Stakeholder Analysis

	Identify the key stakeholders: Who will be influenced by your document? Who is meant to make decisions upon reading your document? Who is going to use your document? Who will have the ability influence how your work is perceived and understood?

Perform AIMS Analysis

	Audience, Issue, Message, Storyline (AIMS). Who is your document for? What is the issue or question that the audience will be struggling with? What are the key points that you want to convey? How can you present the message in a clear, direct and persuasive manner?

Cover Page

	Develop a professional-looking front page with the title of the exercise and your student id.

Sections, Paragraphs, Sentences and Words

	Structure your document intelligently: every sentence, paragraph and section must have a purpose and be logically organised. Select words carefully, purposely and precisely. Avoid ambiguity and do not overuse industry jargon!

Proofread!

	Proofread your document before submitting it for review! Microsoft Word offers features that check for grammatical errors, typos and poorly constructed sentences.

Reading Aids

	Display page numbers. Date your document. Include a Table of Content. Add captions to images and tables. Apply the guidelines for naming your file properly.

	Make your document pleasing to the eyes! Documents that look good get read. Produce work that you can be proud of!
